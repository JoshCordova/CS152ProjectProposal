Project Title: Music Classifier

By using the dataset found on http://millionsongdataset.com/, I plan to deploy a neural network
to be used in an application that will classify music. Since this dataset does not contain genre tags, 
I will not be able to use supervised learning techniques, so this will be done using clustering. To use the application, 
users will upload a song, and the features will be looked up using the Echo Nest API. 

If the clusters are distinct enough, and seem to represent established genres, labels can be added post-clustering to better inform the user about the specific genre of music.
