    <h2><strong>Project Title: Music Classifier</strong></h2>
    <br />
    <div>By using the dataset found on http://millionsongdataset.com/, the plan is to deploy a neural network</div>
    <div>to be used in an application that will classify music. Since this dataset does not contain genre tags,</div>
    <div>We will not be able to use supervised learning techniques, so this will be done using clustering. To use the application,</div>
    <div>users will upload a song, and the features will be looked up using the Spotify (formerly Echo Nest) API.</div>
    <br />
    <div>If the clusters are distinct enough, and seem to represent established genres, labels can be added post-clustering to better inform the user about the specific genre of music.</div>
    <div>If the clusters are not distinct after enough hyperparameter tuning, we can use soft/fuzzy classification to try to come up with a recommender system, and compare it to Spotify's recommendations.</div>
    <br /><strong><em>Specific goals:&nbsp;</em></strong></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <ul>
    <li>Run cluster analysis on the dataset</li>
    <li>Tune hyperparameters (distance metric will likely be the main focus) to get distinct clusters</li>
    <li>Verify that these clusters represent genres</li>
    <li>Add genre tags and train a classification model</li>
    </ul>
